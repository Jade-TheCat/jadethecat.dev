### Notes

- Stress is on the second-to-last syllable, unless another syllable has an acute accent, in which case that syllable is stressed.
- Consecutive vowels are often realized as diphthongs.
    - Vowel sequences containing /ɪ/ are written with &lt;i&gt; instead of &lt;y&gt; to disambiguate for readers, as some sequences, like &lt;ay&gt;, could be confused (in this case, &lt;ay&gt; may be confused for /eɪ/).

#### Allophony

- e &rarr; ə / [-stress] (unstressed /e/ becomes /ə/)
- a &rarr; æ / [-stress] (unstressed /a/ becomes /æ/)

### Notes
- Vowel sequences containing /ɪ/ are written with &lt;i&gt; instead of &lt;y&gt; to disambiguate for readers, as some sequences, like &lt;ay&gt;, could be confused (in this case, &lt;ay&gt; may be confused for /eɪ/).
- Double vowels &lt;aa&gt; &lt;ee&gt; &lt;ii&gt; &lt;oo&gt; &lt;uu&gt; are lengthened.
- Double consonants are most often realized as geminated at the ends of words, but otherwise are the consonant in a previous syllable appearing in the following syllable. 
- The consonants &lt;m&gt; &lt;n&gt; can act as syllabic consonants.
