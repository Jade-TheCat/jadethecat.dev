Children of Andromeda is a world-building project based on stories I created as a young child. I have been working on fleshing out many of the aspects of this world for many years, including making a few conlangs, working on cultures for the main civilizations, and broadly deciding on aesthetics for the universe. The most recent work has been on a [Tumblr blog](https://childrenofandromeda.tumblr.com), on which I plan to make roughly bi-weekly posts about different things in the galaxy of Andromeda, from overviews of cultures to descriptions of specific important materials.

## Overview

Children of Andromeda focuses on an alternate [Local Group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_Group), where the Andromeda Galaxy is home to a few alien civilizations. The focus is on the Xana Arm Federation, formed recently after a crew of Parallans, Celestans, and Tsanans re-visited Earth, which had been observed by the Tsanans for millions of years before they left in the first century CE.
