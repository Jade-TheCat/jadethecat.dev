*[CoA]: Children of Andromeda

Hello there! I'm Jade, a programmer, worldbuilder, and aspiring content creator. I'm currently working on a few projects, including this site as a programming exercise, and a [Tumblr blog](https://childrenofandromeda.tumblr.com/) for my world-building project, Children of Andromeda. Check out my [projects page](/projects/) for more information.

I used to make Minecraft mods, but I am currently taking a break to focus on other things, namely CoA. If you'd like to see what I have released, check [my Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/user/Jade-TheCat) page. If you'd like to contact me, or find me in other places, check out [my Socials page](/socials/).

Please bear with me as I re-build this site from scratch. Expect frequent updates.
